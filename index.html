            In 2018, I got married and I got promoted to a manager position at work. I now manage a virtual team from Virginia, from an office where I know very few people. Being a remote employee has always been a challenge for me as it provides limited options to meet new people, create relationships with my co-workers and continue to develop my skills professionally.
            <br />
            <br />
            2019 is to be a year of learning, development and discovery for me. I want to focus on the learning that I love. Finding ways to forge new relationships and continue to contribute to my work.
            <br  />
            <br  />
            In preparation for my wedding, which I did love, I lost focus on some of the hobbies that really make me happy, so I want to have a renewed focus on those interests and really plan for some down time for myself and my new husband.
